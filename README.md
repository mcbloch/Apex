# ApEx

WORK IN PROGRESS

This is currently only for local developmentt.


Api Explorer.


A project meant to be used as easy frontend to place in front of an api.

Sometimes you don't need an advanced front-end application with thousands of features but you do need to have something more then just curl. 

This is for example convenient as admin interface over your data or as quick solution while building your backend.
